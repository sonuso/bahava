# Hello World
//I don't have a lot of experience with Git or coding. Learning mode. I have a lot of experience as a user of Dating Apps, and I would like to create one for learning purposes. I have some deeper and more complex ideas I'd like to explore around pattern recognition, and data analysis. I would appreciate some coaching. I think it would be fun!!!
//Bahava: I'm looking at a complete dating app free of charge and ads with a focus on qualitative matches based on a high volume of data points user pattern. The app will disgard blind swipes depending on the time between each swipe.
